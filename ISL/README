Download the dataset folders and ISL_CNN.ipynb, ROI_ISL.ipynb and islcnnmodel11.h5. Add them in a single folder.

1)Open ISL_CNN to perform preprocessing and create the model(Optional)

2)The trained model has been saved as 'islcnnmodel11.h5'

3)Open ROI_ISL.ipynb and run. Once the camera interface opens, predict in real time with hand gestures.

Thank you!
